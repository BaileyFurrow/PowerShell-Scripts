# "Super God Mode" For Windows

This PowerShell script <b>creates shortcuts to all special shell folders, named folders, task links, system settings, deep links, and URL protocols in Windows</b>, providing easy access to a wide range of system settings and features.

It was inspired by the famously nicknamed "God Mode" folder and creates many more shortcuts than even that. 

âž¤ Note: It's not really a "mode", that's just a catchy name. Running this doesn't change any system settings, it just creates a folder containing a ton of shortcuts.

## How to Run:

### Option 1 (Easier): Using .Bat Launcher
1. Download the latest version of the script. (Direct link [here](https://github.com/ThioJoe/Windows-Super-God-Mode/releases/latest/download/Super_God_Mode.ps1))
2. Download the launcher batch file to the same location. (Direct link [here](https://github.com/ThioJoe/Windows-Super-God-Mode/releases/latest/download/SuperGodMode-EasyLauncher.bat))
3. Run the batch file.

### Option 2: Manually running

1. Download the latest version of the script. (Direct link [here](https://github.com/ThioJoe/Windows-Super-God-Mode/releases/latest/download/Super_God_Mode.ps1))
2. Open PowerShell to the directory with the script. (Tip: In File Explorer, just type "PowerShell.exe" into the address bar to open it to that path).
3. Run the following command to allow script execution temporarily for the current session. 
   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
   ```
   ^ **Note:** You might see a warning about changing the execution policy, but the `-Scope Process` part ensures that the change is only temporary, and will only apply to that specific PowerShell window, so you can choose to allow. You can read more in [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-5.1#-scope). 
   
5. Run the script:
   ```
   .\Super_God_Mode.ps1
   ```
   - If no parameters are provided, a GUI will appear for easy configuration.
   - You can also run the script with optional parameters (see below).

- `uniqueOutputFolder`: Append a unique identifier to the output folder name to prevent overwriting existing folders.

#### Advanced Arguments

- `-NoGUI`: Skip the GUI dialog and run with default or provided parameters
- `-CustomDLLPath`: Specify a custom DLL file path for shell32.dll

# Extra Tools

The "Extra Tools" folder contains additional scripts that complement the main functionality of Windows Super God Mode:

### Get_DLL_String_Reference.ps1

This script allows you to easily retrieve the localized string of a single specific string reference.

Features:
- Interactively prompts for string references
- Resolves and displays the localized string values
- Supports the `@dllpath,-resourceID` format

Usage:
1. Run the script in PowerShell
2. Enter the string reference when prompted (e.g., `@%SystemRoot%\system32\shell32.dll,-9227`)
3. The script will display the resolved string value

### Windows_XML_String_Resolver.ps1

This script processes entire XML files containing Windows string references and resolves them to their actual string values. Mostly intended to be used with the XML from shell32.dll.mun containing all the Windows task links.

Features:
- Processes entire XML files, replacing string references with their resolved values
- Supports custom DLL paths for resolving strings
- Generates a new XML file with resolved strings

Usage:
```powershell
.\Windows_XML_String_Resolver.ps1 -XmlFilePath "path\to\your\file.xml" [-CustomResourcePaths "shell32=C:\custom\path\shell32.dll", "user32=C:\another\path\user32.mui"] [-Debug]
```

### Get-MS-Settings-Strings.ps1

This script will find text strings of "ms-settings:" in a DLL file and output them to a text file. 
It is a standalone version of the feature built into the main script. Intended mainly for: "C:\Windows\ImmersiveControlPanel\SystemSettings.dll".

Usage:
```
`.\Get-MS-Settings-Strings.ps1 -DllPath "C:\Windows\ImmersiveControlPanel\SystemSettings.dll" -OutputFilePath "SystemSettings-MS-Settings.txt"
```
- If not specified via arguments, the script will prompt the user for the DLL path, and output to the same directory as the script.

### Find_URLs_From_AppxPackage_Files.ps1

This script fetches the URI protocols for each installed AppxPackage via their AppxManifest.xml file, then brute force searches for those URIs in all files in the app's install directory.
It is a standalone version of the feature built into the main script, but might not be up to date!

Usage:
- No arguments necessary:  `.\Find_URLs_From_AppxPackage_Files.ps1`
