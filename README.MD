# PowerShell Scripts

Welcome to my PowerShell scripts! These are random scripts that I create
occassionally and use either rarely or almost daily; there's no inbetween. 

## File Descriptions

### Count.psm1

Counts the number of lines in a file using the built-in `Measure-Object` cmdlet.

### Format-JSON.psm1

Pretty-prints JSON using only one command. By default, two piped commands are 
needed to achieve this. This bring it down to one.

### Get-Calendar.psm1

WIP!! Designed to emulate bash's `cal` command. Very little progress here.

### Get-YouTubePlaylistTime.psm1

Using the YouTube Data API, takes a YouTube playlist and calculates the amount
of time needed to watch an entire playlist.

### Import-HTML.psm1

Imports an HTML file as a COM object, allowing for easier parsing.

### set-headphones.ps1

Literally just change main audio output to headphones. 

### set-speakers.ps1

Literally just change main audio output to speakers. 

### settings.ps1

An exact copy of [this script from SS64](https://ss64.com/ps/syntax-settings.html).
Really, it's just a good reference for `ms-settings` shortcuts.
